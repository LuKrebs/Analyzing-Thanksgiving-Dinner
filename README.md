<p>In this Guided Project on <a href='http://dataquest.io/home'>Dataquest</a> I analyze data on Thanksgiving dinner in the US. The dataset came from <a href='https://fivethirtyeight.com/'> and can be found <a href='https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/thanksgiving-2015'></a>. The dataset is stored in <code>thanksgiving.csv</code> file. It contais <code>1058</code> responses to an online survey about what Americans eat for Thanksgiving dinner. Each survey respondent was asked questions about what they typically eat for Thanksgiving, along with some demographic questions, like their gender, income, and location. </p>

<p>The dataset has <code>65</code> columns, and <code>1058</code> rows.</p>

<p>Most of the columns follow the same question/response format as the above. There are also quite a few <code>NaN</code> values in the columns, which occurred when a survey respondent didn't fill out a question because they didn't want to, or it didn't apply to them.</p>
